## What is this?

This is the second Math Odysse, an inofficial math competition for students from middle school to high school. The concept of the competition is still in developement. Thus this year is very different from its predecessor.\
This time, all problems are meant to only be solvable through trial and error. The problems require a degree of creativity and a load of work that are not recommended to be achieved by a single person.\
The competition is meant to challenge your creativity, intutition, endurance and problem solving skills.

## Who is behind this?

It's me, Oliver Lebold. I'm a college drop out that majored in mathematics with computer science as a minor.
So far, there's not that much to say about me. I set myself the goal to create a math competition every year for self developement.\
This year, I haven't dealt with mechanisms that would give this competition a more official status.\
That would be one of my long term goals.

## How to participate?

Any student that has not completed school yet can participate. Far that you need to make a valid submission as described [here](https://github.com/Pseudoexpertise/Math-Odyssee-II/blob/main/standards/rules.md#correct-submission).

Upon that, there are also other interesting this.
