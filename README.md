## What is this?

This event marks the second iteration of the Math Odyssey, an unofficial mathematics competition intended for students ranging from middle school to high school.\
The conceptual framework of the competition remains in its nascent stages of development. Consequently, the current year is markedly distinct from [the previous one](https://www.overleaf.com/read/jdttxtdrgpdk#da9747).\
In this iteration, all issues are intended to be resolved through a process of trial and error. The challenges posed by these problems necessitate a certain degree of creativity and a substantial amount of work, which is not recommended to be addressed by a single individual.\
The objective of the competition is to assess participants' creativity, intuition, endurance, and problem-solving skills.

## Who is behind this?

I am Oliver Lebold. I am a college dropout with a mathematics major and a computer science minor.\
At this juncture, there is a paucity of information regarding my person. The objective was established to initiate an annual mathematics competition for the purpose of self-development.\
In the present year, no mechanisms have been encountered that would elevate the standing of this competition to a more official status.\
The aforementioned objective constitutes a long-term ambition.

## How to participate?

Any student that has not completed school yet can participate. For that, you need to make a valid submission as described [here](https://github.com/Pseudoexpertise/Math-Odyssee-II/blob/main/standards/rules.md#correct-submission).
