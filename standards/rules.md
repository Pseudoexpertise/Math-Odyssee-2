<h1 align="center">Rules</h1>

### Participants

Participation in this competition is exclusively reserved for school students and those who have recently graduated.\
Group submissions are permitted, with a minimum of one member and a maximum of six members per group.

### Permitted Tools

Provided that the work is produced by the group in question, no restrictions are imposed. Ultimately, it is imperative that each group possesses a comprehensive understanding of their respective project.\
For those who attain a sufficient number of points to win a prize, their submission's authenticity will be verified through an oral examination of their claimed work.

The successful candidates will be awarded prizes.\
It is reasonable to assume that the oral examination, when prepared for in a timely manner, will not pose a significant challenge. This is due to the fact that the examination is entirely dependent on the collaborative efforts of the group, and the assumption that the group will adhere to academic integrity standards by avoiding plagiarism.

### Citations

In the event of **plagiarism**, the submission in its entirety is considered invalid.\
The following is a non-exclusive list of the aforementioned elements:

- The practice of duplicating and transposing text from sources such as books, academic journals, or websites without proper citation
- The utilization of a solution approach or method, as delineated in a book, video, or forum, without the requisite citation of its provenance
- A paraphrased representation of another's fundamental concept

For a **book**, the following citation is required:

- Author
- Title
- Publisher
- Year of Publication
- Page

In the context of a **website**, if the Digital Object Identifier (DOI) is present, the citation process merely necessitates the inclusion of the DOI.\
In the absence of a DOI, the following information is required:

- Uniform Resource Locator (URL)
- Date of visitation

In the event that an **AI prompt** is provided, it is imperative that the citation include the URL that leads to the conversation, as well as the date of the visit.
In the event that a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) cannot be provided, it is necessary to include the following:

- Exact model of the AI
- Date
- External link to a file or place in a file that contains the entire prompt history

One potential method to achieve this objective would be to place the copied and pasted history in the attachment section.

A **video** reference necessitates the following:

- channel or creator
- Title
- Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is a system for identifying resources on the Internet.
- Timestamp
- Date of Visitation


**Graphics**, **pictures**, **diagrams** and similar media must include a link to their source.\
The **bibliography** must include all your references, and all your references must be included in your bibliography.\
Well-known mathematical results from reliable sources do not require proof, but citation.\
Mathematical results from non-reliable sources require proof and citation.\
Your own mathematical results do not require citation. But proof alone is not sufficient. It is mandatory to provide a derivation too.\
As long as after the derivation follows a proof of said statement, the derivation itself does not need to be a proof if it is the evidence that justifies trying to prove said result. In that case, empirical arguments can also be valid.\
Anything you have to look up requires a citation.\
When you do a proof analogously to something you have found in the literature, mention the source you got your idea for the proof from.

### Correct Submission

Your solution must be sent to the [submissions folder](https://github.com/Pseudoexpertise/Math-Odyssee-2/tree/main/submissions) by the 1st of September 2025.\
Your submission must be a folder itself. The name of that folder is the name of your team.\
In that folder, you need to have the file *README.md* that explains how to navigate the files and folders of your submission, such that someone who doesn't have access to the competitions' repository can still navigate your submission.\
Besides the *README.md*, there must be folder *exercises* that contains the files *exercise_k.ipynb* for each exercise k and also the folder bibliography (the same hierarchy as README and exercises) is mandatory. In that folder will be your bibliography. Apart from that, the particular file structure of your bibliography can be arbitrary.\
If you want to include external files, you have to create the folder assets (the same hierarchy as the rest) and put your assets there. Apart from that, the internal structure of the assets folder is arbitrary.
Optionally, you can create a folder named *docs* (again, same hierarchy) where you can place your documentation. Beware that the ipynb format is meant to also document your code to some extent. Some things are better off being documented inside the ipynb file, and some things are better off being documented in an external file. You can organize that folder arbitrarily too.\
Similarly, if you think that some mathematical details and backgrounds succeed the scope of the exercise file, you can put them in a folder, the same level as the README.md, named *theory*, that can also be structured arbitrarily.\
If there are subroutines you don't want to show in your exercise file (they might be too large or too low-level, distracting from the broader picture), you must create an additional folder at the same level as *README.md* named *library*, which you can structure arbitrarily.\
Optionally, you can give your submission a license that is placed at the same level as the README file.\
Any other file or folder beyond the description given here is not allowed.

The *README.md* file must have `# <h1 style="text-align: center">Math Odyssee II</h1>` in its first line, followed by `# <h3 style="text-align: center; margin-top: -20pt">Team Name</h3>`, where in place of *Team Name* you have to insert the name of your team.\
After that, your personal information has to be given in the following format:

| Surname | First Name | Class | School             | e-mail                    |
| -------- | ---------- | ----- | ------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Daniels  | Jack       | 7g1   | Alc-Ohol Gymnasium | jack-daniels.@drukard.com |
| Nuds     | Deese      | 12C   | De Nawdy School    | deese.nuds@nawdy-nt.us    |

Submissions that don't satisfy the format, for some instance and those that came after 09.01.2025, will not be valid!

### Ambiguity

The exercises are meant to be open-ended and slightly vague. In the case of ambiguity, if assumptions need to be made, justify them by their applicability and connection to the model.\
For an optimal submission, your solutions are meant to be correct, verifiable, traceable and applicable.\
Computing the solution given by the form you provided shall not require more computational complexity than is necessary or plausible.
