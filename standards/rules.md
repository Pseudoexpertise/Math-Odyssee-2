<h1 align="center">Rules</h1>

### Participants

Participation in this competition is exclusively reserved for school students and those who have recently graduated.\
Group submissions are permitted, with a minimum of one member and a maximum of six members per group.

### Permitted Tools

Provided that the work is produced by the group in question, no restrictions are imposed. Ultimately, it is imperative that each group possesses a comprehensive understanding of their respective project.\
For those who attain a sufficient number of points to win a prize, their submission's authenticity will be verified through an oral examination of their claimed work.

The successful candidates will be awarded prizes.\
It is reasonable to assume that the oral examination, when prepared for in a timely manner, will not pose a significant challenge. This is due to the fact that the examination is entirely dependent on the collaborative efforts of the group, and the assumption that the group will adhere to academic integrity standards by avoiding plagiarism.

### Citations

In the event of **plagiarism**, the submission in its entirety is considered invalid.\
The following is a non-exclusive list of the aforementioned elements:

- The practice of duplicating and transposing text from sources such as books, academic journals, or websites without proper citation
- The utilization of a solution approach or method, as delineated in a book, video, or forum, without the requisite citation of its provenance
- A paraphrased representation of another's fundamental concept

For a **book**, the following citation is required:

- Author
- Title
- Publisher
- Year of Publication
- Page

In the context of a **website**, if the Digital Object Identifier (DOI) is present, the citation process merely necessitates the inclusion of the DOI.\
In the absence of a DOI, the following information is required:

- Uniform Resource Locator (URL)
- Date of visitation

In the event that an **AI prompt** is provided, it is imperative that the citation include the URL that leads to the conversation, as well as the date of the visit.
In the event that a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) cannot be provided, it is necessary to include the following:

- Exact model of the AI
- Date
- External link to a file or place in a file that contains the entire prompt history

One potential method to achieve this objective would be to place the copied and pasted history in the attachment section.

A **video** reference necessitates the following:

- channel or creator
- Title
- Uniform Resource Locator (URL) is a system for identifying resources on the Internet.
- Timestamp
- Date of Visitation

It is imperative that **graphics**, **pictures**, **diagrams**, and analogous media be accompanied by a link to their source.\
The bibliography is to include all references used in the text, and all references used must be included in the bibliography.\
It is evident that well-known mathematical results, when sourced from reliable publications, do not necessitate proof; rather, citation is sufficient.\
Mathematical results from unreliable sources must be supported by evidence and appropriately cited.\
The mathematical results obtained by the author do not require citation. However, it must be noted that proof alone is not sufficient. It is imperative to provide a derivation as well.\
Provided that after the derivation, a proof of the aforementioned statement is presented, the derivation itself does not necessitate proof. The derivation serves merely as substantiating evidence to support the endeavor to prove the result. In such instances, empirical arguments can also be valid.\
Any information that requires documentation must be accompanied by a citation.\
When a proof is analogous to a concept found in the literature, it is essential to cite the source from which the proof idea was derived.\

### Correct Submission

It is imperative that submissions be directed to the [designated submissions folder](https://github.com/Pseudoexpertise/Math-Odyssee-2/tree/main/submissions) by September 1, 2025.\
It is imperative that the submitted folder be an independent entity. The name of the aforementioned folder corresponds to the name of the team in question.\
Within the designated folder, the *README.md* file must be present. This file contains instructions on how to navigate the files and folders of the submission. Its purpose is to enable individuals who lack access to the competitions' repository to still navigate the submission.\
In addition to the *README.md*, it is imperative that a folder designated as *exercises* be present, containing the files *exercise_k.ipynb* for each designated exercise *k*. The folder designated as *bibliography* must also be present, following the same hierarchical structure as the *README* and *exercises*. The folder containing the bibliography will be available for review. Notwithstanding, the specific file structure of one's bibliography may be selected with a high degree of arbitrariness.\
In order to incorporate external files, it is necessary to create a folder designated as *assets*, which should adhere to the same hierarchical structure as the existing folders. The external files should be placed within this assets folder. Notwithstanding, the internal structure of the assets folder is not dictated by any specific criteria.\
Additionally, one may opt to create a folder named *docs* (again, maintaining the same hierarchy) where documentation may be placed. It is important to note that the ipynb format is intended to serve as a documentation tool for code. In the context of data management and organization, the decision regarding the optimal location for documentation hinges upon the nature of the information in question. In certain instances, the most suitable location for documentation is within the ipynb file, while in other scenarios, an external file may be the more appropriate venue. The folder's organization can also be established in an arbitrary manner.\
Likewise, in the event that one deems certain mathematical details and backgrounds to exceed the scope of the exercise file, one has the option of placing them in a folder, situated at the same level as the README.md, and naming it *theory*. This folder can also be structured in an arbitrary manner.\
In the event that subroutines are deemed unnecessary for display within the exercise file, such as those that are either too voluminous or too fundamental to the task at hand, it is imperative to create an additional folder at the same level as README.md. This additional folder should be named *library* and can be structured in accordance with the user's discretion.
Optionally, submissions may be accompanied by a license, which would be placed at the same level as the README file.\
The presence of any additional files or folders beyond those specified in the provided description is strictly prohibited.

It is imperative that the README.md file contains `# <h1 style="text-align: center">Math Odyssee II</h1>` on its first line, followed by  `# <h3 style="text-align: center; margin-top: -20pt">Team Name</h3>`, where *Team Name* is to be substituted with the name of the team in question.\
Subsequently, the personal information of the individual in question must be submitted in the following format:

| Surname | First Name | Class | School             | e-mail                    |
| -------- | ---------- | ----- | ------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Daniels  | Jack       | 7g1   | Alc-Ohol Gymnasium | jack-daniels.@drukard.com |
| Nuds     | Deese      | 12C   | De Nawdy School    | deese.nuds@nawdy-nt.us    |

Submissions that do not adhere to the prescribed format, or those received after September 1, 2025, will be deemed invalid.

### Ambiguity

The exercises are meant to be open-ended and slightly vague. In the case of ambiguity, if assumptions need to be made, justify them by their applicability and connection to the model.\
For an optimal submission, your solutions are meant to be correct, verifiable, traceable and applicable.\
Computing the solution given by the form you provided shall not require more computational complexity than is necessary or plausible.
