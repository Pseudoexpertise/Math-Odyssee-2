<h1 align="center">Rules</h1>

### Participants

Only school students and those that have graduated from school this year can participate in this competition.\
You can submit as a group of at least one member and at most six members.

### Permitted Tools

Everything is allowed as long as it's your group's work. In the end, you, as a group, must be familiar with your own project.\
For those that succeed enough points to win a prize, their submission's authenticity will be verified by an oral exam of their, so claimed, own work.

Only the ones that pass the exam will win the prize.\
With one or two days of preparation, the oral exam is not meant to be difficult, given that it is entirely your group's work and you did not do plagiarism.

### Citations

In the case of **plagiarism**, the entire submission is considered invalid.\
This includes (but not exclusively):

- Copying and pasting from books, papers or websites without declaring it as a citation
- Using a solution approach/method that you have found in a book, video or forum without mentioning its origin
- Paraphrasing someone else's core idea

For a **book**, your citation must include:

- Author
- Title
- Publisher
- Year
- Page

For a **website**, if the DOI exists, your citation only requires the DOI.\
If no DOI exists, it requires:

- URL
- Date of visitation

If provided, for an **AI prompt**, your citation must include the URL that leads to the conversation and the date you visited it.\
If such a URL cannot be provided, you have to include the:

- Exact model of the AI
- Date
- External link to a file or place in a file that contains the entire prompt history

You could, for instance, put the copied and pasted history in the attachment part.

A **video** reference requires listing:

- Channel or Creator
- Title
- URL
- Timestamp
- Date of Visitation

**Graphics**, **pictures**, **diagrams** and similar media must include a link to their source.\
The **bibliography** must include all your references, and all your references must be included in your bibliography.\
Well-known mathematical results from reliable sources do not require proof, but citation.\
Mathematical results from non-reliable sources require proof and citation.\
Your own mathematical results do not require citation. But proof alone is not sufficient. It is mandatory to provide a derivation too.\
As long as after the derivation follows a proof of said statement, the derivation itself does not need to be a proof if it is the evidence that justifies trying to prove said result. In that case, empirical arguments can also be valid.\
Anything you have to look up requires a citation.\
When you do a proof analogously to something you have found in the literature, mention the source you got your idea for the proof from.

### Correct Submission

Your solution must be sent to the [submissions folder](https://github.com/Pseudoexpertise/Math-Odyssee-2/tree/main/submissions) until the 1st of September 2025.\
Your submission must be a folder itself. The name of that folder is the name of your team.\
In that folder, you need to have the file *README.md* that explains how to navigate the files and folders of your submission such that someone who doesn't have access to the competitions repository can still navigate your submisson.\
Besides the *README.md*, there must be the folder *exercises* that contains the files *exercise_k.ipynb* for each exercise *k* and also the folder *bibliography* (the same hierarchiy as READMe and exercises) is mandatory. In that folder will be your bibliography. Apart from that, the particular file structure of your bibliography can be arbitrary.\
If you want to inculde external files, you have to create the folder *assets* (the same hierarchy as the rest) and put your assets there. Apart from that, the internal structure of the *assets* folder is arbitrary.\
Optionally, you can create a folder named *docs* (again, same hierarchy) where you can place your documentation. Beware that the .ipynb format is meant to also document your code to some extend. Some things are better to be documented inside the .ipynb file and some things are better to be documented by an external file. You can organize that folder arbitrarily too.\
Similarly, if you think that some mathematical details and backgrounds succed the scope of the exercise file, you can put them in a folder, the same level as the *README.md*, named *theory* that can also be structured arbitrarily.\
If there are subroutines you don't want to show in your exercise file (they might be too large or too low-level, distracting from the broader picture), you must create an additional folder the same level as *README.md* named *library*, which you can structure arbitrarily.\
Optionally, you can give your submission a license that is placed at the same level as readme file.\
Any other file or folder beyond the description given here is not allowed.

The *README.md* file must have `# <h1 style="text-align: center">Math Odyssee II</h1>` in its first line followed by `# <h3 style="text-align: center; margin-top: -20pt">Team name</h3>`, where in place of *Team name* you have to insert the name of your team.\
After that, your personal information has to be given by the following format:

| Surname | First Name | Class | School             | e-mail                    |
| -------- | ---------- | ----- | ------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Daniels  | Jack       | 7g1   | Alc-Ohol Gymnasium | jack-daniels.@drukard.com |
| Nuds     | Deese      | 12C   | De Nawdy School    | deese.nuds@nawdy-nt.us    |

Submissions that don't satisfy the format for some instance and those that came after 09.01.2025 will not be valid!

### Ambiguity

The exercises are meant to be open ended and slightly vague. In the case of ambiguity, if assumptions are need to be made, justify them by their applicability and connection to the model.\
For a an optimal submission, your solutions are meant to be correct, verifiable, traceable and applicable.\
Computing the solution given by the form you provided shall not require more computational complexity than necessary or plausible.
